ORMs allow applications to manage a database using high-level entities such as classes, objects and methods which can be easily incorporated into various functions inside a flask app, instead of the conventional way of storing data in sql in the form of tables. The job of the ORM is to translate the high-level operations into database commands. The Flask-SQLAlchemy extension takes the location of the application's database from the 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' configuration variable. The database is represented into the flask application by creating an instance of it. SQLAlchemy provides a plethora of functions to retrieve and/or manipulate data from the database. With Regards to the project, we did not use SQLAlchemy, instead, with the help of the official SQLite-Python API, I attempted to create an interface similar to that of SQLAlchemy, with mostly similar functions."

              "note": "App Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL. In a Flask application, routes are defined using decorators (@app.route). Decorators are used to associate a URL path and an HTTP method with a Python function, which will handle the corresponding request. For example, if a user visits the web app at the mentioned route in .route('/'), the function defined below the @app.route('/') is then executed. In addition to accepting the URL of a route as a parameter, the @app.route() decorator can accept a second argument: a list of accepted HTTP methods, such as 'GET', 'POST' or 'PUT'. In a stateless client-server architecture, each request is treated independently, and the server doesn't maintain any client-specific information between requests. The Flask routes operate in this stateless manner. Each request received by the server is handled separately, and the route handler is responsible for generating a response based on the current request's data. In our project, these decorators were used - @app.route('/'), @app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST']), @app.route('/login', methods=['GET','POST']), @app.route('/chat', methods=['GET','POST']), @app.route('/logout'), for browsing home page, registering a user, logging in, accessing chat menu and logging out respectively."

          <h3>Implementing the Google Maps Interface</h3>
          <h4>-> What is the Google Maps Platform ?</h4>
          The Google Maps Platform is a map visualisation API to search for locations, obtain directions, and access various geographic and navigational information, by providing the users the ability to interact with an interface similar to the official Google Maps App.
          It enables the developers to build dynamic, interactive, deeply customized maps, location, and geospatial experiences for their web apps.
          <h4>-> Why integrate the Google Maps Platform ?</h4>
          This provides a visual representation of the travel destinations and accommodations that the users can plan to visit. This integration would have endless benefits to improve the overall user experience of Travelisor.
          <ul>
            <li>Users can get a visual representation of the travel destinations and accommodations they are planning to visit.</li>

            <li>Slack - Using Slack users can communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media, and files in private chats or as part of communities called "workspaces". In addition to these online communication features, Slack can integrate with other software, for example Figma, mentioned above. Slack runs on Web, Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, Windows Phone and iOS.

          <h3>Collaboration and Team Communication: Process</h3>
          Managing communication between team-members is very crucial for a consistent progress with the project. I have a few recommendations to make with regards to this subject, from experience that I gained from working on this project - 
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid assigning multiple tasks to a single person at one time. The overall work would be lees optimal than if it would have been done in chunks. Make sure you divide the project into enough parts that they feel more like a task than a 'hassle' to wrap-up quick. This granular approach will also help in refining each section of a project better.</li><br>
            <li>Set realistic expectations from each team-member. Discuss clearly and make sure everyone understands the work they are doing. Arbitrary communication like "will you be able to handle this?" won't necessarily work properly and you'll end up with either work being incomplete or the quality of the work being sub-par.</li><br>
            <li>Apart from group discussions, make sure that each team-member is comfortable with contacting any other member of their team on their own. This is especially important if two people are working on sections that are intertwined. In our case, I was responsible for handling the database and creating a database interface with functions to be used in the flask app,
              which is why apart from general group discussions about project progress, I also had to have a proper communication with my team-member who was working on the flask app.
            </li><br>
            <li>Make sure every team member keeps their other team-members up-to-date with the status of their work. 
              Constant feedback regarding the proper functioning of the assigned section is very crucial and helps other team members stay on track with their own work without worrying too much about progress of others. 
              In our case, we were constantly communicating with each other with regards to whether the function is working as intended, and/or any other part is missing or needs to be implemented as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="advice-3">
          <h3>Project Delivery and Deadline Management: Prioritization</h3>
          It is understandable that team-members can possibly have other work commitments or deadlines coming up. Hence it is every member's duty to make sure that things with the project aren't left behind while prioritizing other work over the project. 
          <ul>
            <li>Establish clear project goals, defining the scope of the project. Everyone needs to understand what the project demands and shouldn't waste any extra time trying to understand this. Most of everyone's alloted time for this project should be spent on researching and implementation.</li><br>
            <li>Create a project timeline with specific milestones and deadlines. Identify critical tasks and set realistic deadlines for each one. Make sure the timeline accounts for individual commitments and allows for flexibility.</li><br>
            <li>Maintain regular communication with your team members. Schedule meetings or use communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to keep everyone informed about project updates, progress, and challenges. The more you seem supportive and collaborative, the easier it gets for everyone to be on the same page.</li><br>
            <li>Make sure everyone understands the project's importance and is sincerely alloting time for this project. Set up regular checks of task progress and completion.</li><br>
            <li>One of the most important things is to make sure you atleast implement the required bare minimum. Avoid getting too excited and going off tangents, trying to implement a feature which is not absolutely necessary.</li><br>
          </ul>
