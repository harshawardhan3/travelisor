Implementing the Google Maps Interface
-> What is the Google Maps Platform ?
The Google Maps Platform is a map visualisation API to search for locations, obtain directions, and access various geographic and navigational information, by providing the users the ability to interact with an interface similar to the official Google Maps App. It enables the developers to build dynamic, interactive, deeply customized maps, location, and geospatial experiences for their web apps.

This provides a visual representation of the travel destinations and accommodations that the users can plan to visit. This integration would have endless benefits to improve the overall user experience of Travelisor.
Users can get a visual representation of the travel destinations and accommodations they are planning to visit.
By using custom icons onto the map, users can quickly identify and locate specific destinations they are interested in.
